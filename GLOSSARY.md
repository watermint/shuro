# Glossary

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Shuro project to maintain consistency.

## Core Concepts

**Shuro**: The name of this automated subtitle translation workflow application.

**Transcription**: The process of converting audio speech to text using whisper-cpp.

**Translation**: The process of converting transcribed text from one language to another using LLM.

**Tuning**: The process of optimizing whisper transcription parameters to minimize hallucinations and improve quality.

**Hallucination**: False or repetitive content generated by the speech recognition model that doesn't correspond to actual audio.

**Quality Score**: A numerical metric used to evaluate transcription quality based on factors like repetitive segments, token count, and hallucination presence.

## Technical Terms

**Tempo**: Audio playback speed adjustment used during transcription tuning (80-120% of normal speed).

**Exploration Model**: A smaller, faster whisper model used during the tuning phase to find optimal parameters.

**Transcription Model**: A larger, more accurate whisper model used for final transcription after optimal parameters are found.

**Segment**: A time-bounded portion of transcribed text with start/end timestamps.

**SRT**: SubRip Subtitle format - a standard subtitle file format with timestamps.

**Ollama**: Local LLM inference server used for translation and quality validation.

**FFmpeg**: Multimedia framework used for audio extraction and subtitle embedding.

## Quality Metrics

**Repetitive Segments**: The ratio of duplicated text segments in a transcription.

**Max Tokens**: The maximum number of tokens in any single transcription segment.

**No Speech Probability**: Confidence metric from whisper indicating likelihood of silence.

**Compression Ratio**: Metric from whisper indicating text density relative to audio duration.

## Workflow States

**Mature Transcription**: A transcription that has passed quality validation and hallucination detection.

**Validated Translation**: A translation that has been approved by LLM quality assessment.

**Embedded Subtitles**: Final video file with subtitles permanently added using FFmpeg.

## Configuration

**Acceptable Languages**: List of source languages that whisper can detect and transcribe.

**Fallback Language**: Default language assumed when language detection fails.

**Quality Threshold**: Minimum acceptable translation quality level (good/fair/poor).

**Explore Steps**: Number of different tempo values to test during tuning.
